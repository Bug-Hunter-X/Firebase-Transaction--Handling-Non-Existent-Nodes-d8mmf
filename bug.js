The following code snippet demonstrates a potential issue when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  The transaction attempts to increment a counter, but if the counter is not initialized in the database, the transaction might fail, leading to unexpected behavior. This is often due to a race condition or concurrency issues where the transaction attempts to operate on a non-existent node.

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('counters/myCounter').transaction(function(current) {
  if (current === null) {
    return 1; // Attempting to initialize, but might fail due to race condition
  }
  return current + 1;
});
```
