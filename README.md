# Firebase Transaction: Handling Non-Existent Nodes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Realtime Database transactions where the transaction might fail due to race conditions when attempting to operate on a node that does not yet exist.  This is especially critical when initializing counters or other similar operations.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that addresses this issue.

## Problem

Firebase transactions are atomic, but if they attempt to operate on a null value, the transaction might not update the database correctly.  This can lead to inconsistency and data loss, especially in concurrent scenarios.

## Solution

The solution involves using `set()` to create the node before attempting a transaction or using a more robust approach that includes checking for the node's existence within the transaction function itself.
